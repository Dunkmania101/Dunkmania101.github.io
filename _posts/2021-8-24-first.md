Hello! I'm Dunkmania101 and welcome to my website and blog!
This is the first post, just to establish what it's all about!


On this site, as you might guess, I'll be posting entries about stuff I'm working on.
It'll also be the home of any web-related things I make.
Here's its source on GitHub: [Page Source](https://github.com/Dunkmania101/Dunkmania101.github.io)


At the time of writing this _(Aug. 24, 2021)_, I'm making a sandbox-survival-automation game called Saoirse (pronounced *"Seer-sha"*).
I'll be posting updates on its development here.


See you in the next post!
