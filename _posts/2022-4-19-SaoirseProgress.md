Hello again! This is post 6 on the development progress of my Saoirse (pronounced "Seer-Sha") game.

Here's a quick summary of what I've done since the last post:

    1. I switched away from Pyglet because I am a programmer and programmers respond to things they struggle with by struggling even more and doing things on their own. I'm using Pillow and Tk now. This does have the advantage of working on older graphics cards and being more portable and minimalistic, plus it's easier to export individual frames.

    2. Lots of miscellaneous refactoring and cleaning up throughout the project.

Its Git repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Dunkmania101/Saoirse) and mirrored [here](https://gitlab.com/dunkmania101/Saoirse).
