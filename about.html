<h2>About</h2>

<p>
  Hi, I'm Dunkmania101 and you've reached my personal website.
</p>

<p>
  I'm a programmer and a musician. I like to explore how things work and, when it's appropriate, find it entertaining to "Josh" them, which is a term I use to describe testing ways to get systems to work in new ways that were not expected. It's a reference to the Youtube channel "Let's Game It Out".

  Thanks for stopping by!
