<p><strong>SOFTWARE ENGINEER</strong></p>
<p>I am a software engineer who began programming around 2018. I can
work in multiple languages and am comfortable with the version control
system Git. I use Linux on all of my hardware and am comfortable at the
command line.</p>
<p>I’ve always wanted to be an “engineer”, which I put in quotes as I
didn’t fully understand what that meant when I first decided on it. What
I’ve always appreciated is the ability to will something useful into
existence, as the former NASA engineer Mark Rober put it. I’ve since
decided that I want to work as a programmer professionally.</p>
